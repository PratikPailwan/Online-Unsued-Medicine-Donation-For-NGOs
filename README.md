# Online-Unsued-Medicine-Donation-For-NGOs
This project, created with HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap, focuses on donating unused medicines to those in need.

The application facilitates the donation process, allowing users to contribute their unused medicines to an NGO.

The system involves three entities: Admin, NGO, and Member.

The Admin, upon login, manages members by handling improper or expired medicine donations, including the ability to delete or block users.

Admin also approves appointment requests made by NGOs and maintains a monthly report of donated medicines.

NGOs can register and log in using credentials, enabling them to request appointments that are approved and scheduled by the admin.

NGOs manage their medicine stock, ensuring a record of available medicines, and can enhance security by changing their password.

Members can register and log in using their credentials, donating medicines by providing details and raising a request, which is then approved and scheduled by the admin.

Members can also review their past transactions, checking the details of previously donated medicines.

Before running this project, it is necessary to install Bootstrap, bootstrap-social, and font awesome.
